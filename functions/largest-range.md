Given an array of numbers, write a function that returns the largest range.
A range is a set of consecutive integers between two values. (ie: a range of [0,5] represents 0,1,2,3,4,5)
The largest range should be an array of length two.
With the first integer being less than the second integer.
You should write this function in javascript.
Input [1,5,6,3,9,85,63,4]
Output [3,6]
